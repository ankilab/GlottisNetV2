The glottal midline and the glottal area are two important features for analyzing the voice. Here we provide **GlottisNetV2**, an open-source deep learning architecture to estimate the glottal midline and the glottal area.

# Installation 

GlottisNetV2 can be installed directly from the GitHub Repository.
